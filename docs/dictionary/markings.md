# Markings: Product Labeling

"Markings" refer to the text on the case and AirPods that provide general information about the product. This is also known as "Product Labeling". This labeling typically includes the "Designed by Apple in California" text, as well as model numbers and serial numbers that can be used to identify the specific product and its features. This labeling is important for providing consumers with important information about the product, such as its compatibility with other devices and its warranty coverage.
