# Knockoffs

"Knockoffs" refer to a spin-off or recreation of a product that is noticeably not the same branding as the brand it's trying to "knock-off". This is often done to avoid counterfeit product charges or infringement of intellectual property rights.

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how "Knockoffs" can be used:

"He got those 'Gucce' shoes on." In this context, "Gucce" shoes would be considered knockoffs of the original "Gucci" shoes.
