## V4.9 Version Differences:

**TB** - The TB headset is known for its white, tougher case that is more sweatproof than the HR model. It also features a ST gyroscope, similar to the V4.7 and Retail versions, which provides excellent spatial audio. With ANC on, it has a battery life of 6 hours, while the HR model only lasts for 4 hours.

**HR** - The HR headset has a yellowish, softer case that is less sweatproof than the TB model. It also has slightly better ANC performance, although it is similar in most situations, with occasional differences of up to 1DB. The battery life of the HR model is 6 hours without ANC, and 4 hours with ANC turned on.

## V4.5 Version Differences:

**HiCity HR V4.5:** The HiCity HR V4.5 headset features a new 1:1 hinge design, which provides a more comfortable and secure fit than previous models. It also has hybrid ANC technology, which effectively blocks out a wide range of external noise. With a midrange battery life of 5-6 hours without ANC, it is the best option for those who value aesthetics in their headphones. (Make sure that the 1:1 hinge is mentioned in the product listing)

*Jenny's HR V4.5 DOES NOT have the 1:1 Hinge!*

**Jenny Tigerbuilder V4.5:** The Jenny Tigerbuilder V4.5 has less static ANC, but slightly lower DB performance. It has the best battery life of the V4.5 models, lasting up to 8 hours without ANC, making it the best choice for endurance.

**HiCity Flying Tiger V4.5:** The HiCity Flying Tiger V4.5 has more advanced ANC technology, which blocks out more DB of external noise, but has slightly more static than the other models. Its battery life is better than the Dongguan HR, but not as long as the Tigerbuilder, lasting around 6 hours without ANC. This makes it the best all-around option for those who want a balance of performance and battery life.

Please note that older pro clone models have been removed from the list as we do not encourage anyone to buy older versions than these.
