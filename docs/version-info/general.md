## FAQ

::: details Are AirPods Max reps available?
AirPods Max replicas have been released, but are not fully polished yet. Jenny and HiCity have recently started selling AirPods Max replicas using the Airoha 1561M. The current price is $120, but prices are expected to decrease in the future as factories continue to develop these replicas. For updates, visit r/AirReps and the AirReps Discord.

::: details Why might similar communities have newer products than this guide?
The products listed in this guide are the highest quality and are carefully selected to meet our standards. We update the list every day to ensure that only the best products are included. Other communities may have lower standards and may include products that are not as high-quality. It is also possible that they use a different naming scheme for their products, which could make it appear as though they have newer products than this guide.
:::

::: details Which model is the best?
The top-listed model is the latest one, while the other models are previous versions. To find the best one for you, consider factors such as your budget, shipping availability, and desired features. It is also a good idea to search for reviews of the different models and make your own decision based on that information.

::: details How can I determine the version of a clone I found?
It is not possible to determine the version of a clone without actually using it. The chip numbers and pictures provided by sellers are not reliable indicators of a clone's version. Asking sellers if a particular clone is a certain version will not provide useful information, as they may not understand the question. If you are willing to take the risk, you can purchase a random clone. However, to ensure that you know exactly which model you are getting, it is best to purchase from verified sellers.

::: details How can I determine the chip in my AirPods?
To check the chip in your AirPods, you can try downloading the Airoha Headset app and attempting to connect your AirPods to it. If they connect, then they are using an Airoha chip. You can also [download the AirReps 156X Airoha app on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airoha.utapp.sdk) and use it to connect your AirPods. The app will provide information about the chipset in your AirPods, but only if they are using an Airoha chip. If your AirPods do not connect to either of these apps, you can use the following method:

Check the audio codec of your AirPods. To do this you need to use an Android 8.1 or Higher but lower than 10 device, or Mac.

- Android Method: [Here](https://airreps.info/androidcodeccheck)
- Mac OS Method: [Here](https://airreps.info/maccodeccheck)

At the moment, it is hard to tell from the codec, as most chipsets now support AAC, but if it has SBC you can be sure the reps are using a lower-end chipset.

::: details How can I determine if my AirPods are real?
To quickly check if your AirPods are real, connect them to an iPhone and go to Settings > General > About. If there is an "AirPods" section when you scroll down, check that the serial number shown there matches the serial number on the inside of the AirPods lid ([Check Here](http://airreps.info/aboutsection)). If there is no AirPods section, then your AirPods are likely fake. Some newer replica AirPods may have a functioning "About" page, in which case you can check for the presence of Spatial Audio and head tracking. For AirPods, you can also check the firmware version in the About page to ensure that it matches the latest version released by Apple. If you are unsure about the authenticity of your AirPods and cannot check before purchasing, you can ask for help on the [r/airreps subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirReps/) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/airreps).

::: details Are i9999, Superpods, etc. better than Supercopy or the products listed in the guide?
In the past, these names were used to indicate upgrades or improvements to replica AirPods. However, Chinese sellers have started using these names to make it appear as though they are offering newer or better products when they are actually just selling the same products as before. As a result, these names no longer carry any meaning and should be ignored. Instead, focus on the actual features and quality of the products when making a purchasing decision.
