# Battery Life

Understanding the battery life of AirPods replicas can help you manage your expectations and use them effectively.

## Average Battery Life

The average battery life of AirPods replicas is around 5 hours per charge with normal use at a normal volume (75%). The AirPods case can fully charge the pods 2-3 times on average after a full charge. The newer AirPods Gen 2 replica, the V3M/V3U, claims a battery life of 5-6 hours per charge.

## Battery Life Variations

The actual battery life may slightly vary depending on the version, chip, and specific batch. Some newer models might reach up to 6-8 hours of battery time, but this is not guaranteed.

::: tip
Battery life might reach up to 6-8 hours on newer models, but this is not guaranteed.

## Battery Level Accuracy

The battery levels on iOS devices may not always be accurate. However, just like the original AirPods, the replicas will beep when the battery is low (20%). On Android, battery levels can be checked in Bluetooth Devices or using apps like TWTools, Materialpods, or Andropods. This issue has been resolved in newer replicas.

::: warning
Battery level readings on iOS devices may not always be accurate. Use specific apps on Android for more accurate readings.

## Wireless Charging

AirPods replicas support wireless charging, but use caution when using this feature. Prolonged wireless charging (longer than the 1-2 hours it takes to fully charge the replicas) could lead to overheating and a very small risk of melting. Fast charging (using a cable or wirelessly) may also damage the replicas, so exercise caution if you plan to use this feature.

::: danger
Be careful when using wireless charging for extended periods or fast charging, as it could lead to overheating, melting, or damage to the replicas.
