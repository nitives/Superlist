# Connectivity

Understanding the connectivity of AirPods replicas can help you make an informed purchasing decision.

## iOS Popup

The iOS popup appears almost instantly on some AirPods replicas, although the speed may vary based on the seller and batch. In some cases, the popup may appear faster than on original AirPods.

## Range

The range of most AirPods replicas matches that of the original AirPods, around 10 meters. However, obstructions like thick walls can affect this range.

## Latency

Some AirPods replicas may have better latency than original AirPods, resulting in improved audio-video synchronization. Websites like YouTube automatically adjust for latency.

## Multi-Device Connectivity

Currently, no available replicas support connecting to multiple devices at once using iCloud Connect.

::: warning
AirPods replicas do not support multi-device connectivity through iCloud Connect.

## macOS Compatibility

Newer clone models might face difficulty connecting to macOS. If you encounter this issue, refer to the Troubleshooting section for potential solutions.

## iOS Audio Playback

Certain batches or units of AirPods replicas may face issues playing audio on iOS, often due to Apple WatchOS 7+. This can cause iOS to direct all audio output to the watch instead of the AirPods. Models V3M, V4.5, and newer versions have addressed this issue. The fix for this issue can be found in the Troubleshooting section.
