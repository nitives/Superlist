# Sound Quality

Assessing the sound quality of AirPods replicas can help you determine their performance relative to the original AirPods.

## Sound Quality Rating

The best widely available AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Pro replicas score about 8-9/10 in sound quality when compared to the original AirPods.

::: details Do AirPods Pro sound better than AirPods 2 and 3?
Since AirPods Pro seal into the ear, they may sound significantly better than AirPods 2/3, which are shaped to let outside noise in. However, the AirPods 2/3 clones do sound closer to the original than the AirPods Pro clones at this point. It is recommended to choose the shape and fit that is preferred.

## Sound Quality Variations

Sound quality can vary depending on the version, chip, and batch. Many models emphasize bass without being overpowering. Mids are pronounced, but highs could be improved. Note that the EQ can vary by seller, and you can adjust it using your music player's settings.

## Delay

The delay is around 50-150 ms depending on the version, barely noticeable. For reference, the original AirPods have a delay of between 140-200 ms.

## Sound Issues

Some older batches might have a faint clicking sound in one ear when no audio is playing, which should disappear when audio is played. There's currently no known fix for this. Some batches may also have one ear louder than the other; this can be fixed in settings or physically for a better effect, as described in the troubleshooting section at [https://airreps.info/lrfix](https://airreps.info/lrfix).

::: warning
Some older batches might have a faint clicking sound or uneven sound between the ears. Check the troubleshooting section for fixes.
