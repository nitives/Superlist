# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We value all our contributors and aim to make the process as easy and straightforward as possible.

Before contributing, please take a moment to read and understand these guidelines. They are intended to ensure that everyone understands what is expected, and to help make the process efficient and effective for everyone involved.

## Creating a Pull Request

1. Make sure that your code does not include any unnecessary files or dependencies. These should be removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. We ask that you follow our formatting practices. While we do not enforce strict styles, consistency with the existing codebase makes the project easier to understand and maintain.
3. The `main` branch is protected, so please create a new branch for your changes. Choose a descriptive name that reflects your changes.
4. Use descriptive commit messages that explain the changes you are making. If necessary, add further explanation in the commit description.
5. When you create your pull request, provide a detailed description of the changes and the reasons for them. This helps the reviewers understand your thought process and review your contribution more effectively.
6. Your changes will be merged only after they have been reviewed by a member of the AirReps staff.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please create a new issue. Include as much detail as you can, including steps to reproduce the bug if possible. This will help us to address the issue more effectively.

## Contributions without Coding

Even if you're not comfortable coding, you can still contribute to the project. If you have an idea for improvement or spot an error, simply create a new issue and describe what you've found or what you propose. This can be anything from spotting a typo, suggesting a new idea, or proposing a better way to organize content. Every contribution, no matter how small, is valued and appreciated!

Thank you again for your contribution. We look forward to working with you!
